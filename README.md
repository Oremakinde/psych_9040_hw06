This repository contains my submission for Homework 6 of PSYCH 9040. The assignment involves creating a directed graph that outlines the data processing workflow for a sample EEG dataset.

## Project Overview

The diagram details a three-stage process:
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**  
   - **Input:** Raw EEG binary files (gray nodes)  
   - **Processing:** Code blocks to load, convert, and reorganize data into processed CSV files (red blocks)
2. **Visualization & Intermediate Analysis:**  
   - **Input:** Processed CSV files  
   - **Processing:** Code blocks for generating figures and computing measurements, resulting in intermediate data tables and visual outputs.
3. **Final Statistical Analysis & Reporting:**  
   - **Input:** Data tables from stage 2  
   - **Processing:** Statistical analysis and final visualizations

The diagram follows the guidelines from the clean code practices and Jörn Diedrichsen’s blog, where inputs are shown in gray and processing steps and arrows in red.
